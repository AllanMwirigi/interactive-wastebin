# just going to use the maximum resolution so the argument is not provided. But if you find that there is a lag, you are likely sending too many pixels. If that is the case, you may reduce your resolution quite easily. Just pick from one of the resolutions available for the PiCamera V2 here: https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.12/fov.html . The second table is for V2.
# Once youâ€™ve chosen the resolution, edit like this: vs = VideoStream(usePiCamera=True, resolution=(320, 240)).start()
# vs = VideoStream(usePiCamera=True).start()
# As an alternative, you can insert a frame = imutils.resize(frame, width=320) between Lines 28 and 29 to resize the frame manually.
