# Interactive Wastebin
A smart waste bin that monitors the level of trash within it, alerts users when it is full and shares audio information on environmental conservation.\
Metrics on the current volume of the bin are sent to an online platform and when full, garbage collectors are notified via email and SMS.\
The smart bin is controlled by Python scripts running on a Raspberry Pi.\
The online platform is built in Node.js, React and MongoDB database.\
Data is published and synchronized automatically via Websockets.
